This is software for raspberry pi in which a laundry was managed through an interface and a POS.

Problem, the program does not adjust to the needs of the laundry, it only allows a single payment value (preventing having washes of several values) and also does not allow putting more money into the dryers so that they extend their drying time. And worse, there is an option to give away a wash, a button is activated that must be selected, but in dryers you can press it infinitely, giving away all the time in the world.

Does anyone know about raspberrys that can help me?

Thank you
